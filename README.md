# RemoteToolsB98
A collection of tools that only have to be pasted into a file at the start of it for them to work, for Befunge-98.

Since Befunge-98 is not a known programming language for many, I will leave some resources to it, so you can check it for yourselves.

There will also be an online interpreter in case you cannot or you do not want to use a local interpreter on your machine:
